            My name is alexandre jiresse lusa, and I am currently studying Web Development at <byu-idioh></byu-idioh>. I have always been interested in technology, and this course is allowing me to expand my knowledge in web design and development. My goal is to work as a front-end developer, creating user-friendly websites and applications. In my free time, I enjoy learning new programming languages, experimenting with design tools, and contributing to open-source projects. I look forward to honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I continue this course and work towards my career goals.
